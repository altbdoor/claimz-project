# claimz-project

A small experiment to see how I would build a _very_ boiled down claims system with Django.

Made with:

- [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/)
- [Django 5](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- [django-model-utils](https://github.com/jazzband/django-model-utils/) for timestamped models
- [django-crispy-forms](https://github.com/django-crispy-forms/django-crispy-forms/) to render the forms
  - with [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/)

And dev tools with:

- [djlint](https://www.djlint.com/)
- [black](https://github.com/psf/black)
- [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort)
- [poe](https://github.com/nat-n/poethepoet)

And also a dash of frontend magic with:

- [font-awesome 4](https://fontawesome.com/v4/) for icons
- [select2](https://select2.org/) for an easier to use dropdowns
- [alpinejs](https://alpinejs.dev/) for JS interactivity
